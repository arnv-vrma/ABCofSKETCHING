        <h3>1. Quality Drawing Pencils</h3>
        <li>We’ll start off with the most obvious essential – quality drawing pencils. When it comes to drawing pencils,
            each artist will find a brand that they connect with. There’s no way to know which brand will become your
            favorite until you try a few.</li>
        <li>Pencil sets usually come packaged in nice tins and can be great because they often include the full spectrum
            of graphite grades. Many sets include pencils with harder graphite (9H) through softer graphite (6B). Harder
            graphite makes lighter marks and keeps a sharp tip longer, while softer graphite makes a darker mark, but
            needs constant resharpening. These sets give the artist the ability to work with many different values and
            varieties of mark. Learn more about the different grades of graphite here.

            As far as pencil brands go, there are plenty of great options. Derwent graphite pencils are consistent in
            their quality and is the brand I recommend.</li>

        <h3>2. A Sketchbook</h3>
        <li>
            A sketchbook is one of the most important things an artist can have. I should point out that I am referring
            to an “active sketchbook” – one that receives attention on a daily basis. Anyone can “own” a book with blank
            pages of drawing paper. But the one that actively gets drawn in – on a daily basis is the one of value.Since
            a sketchbook is recommended for daily practice, it is important to choose one that is durable and has plenty
            of pages for all of your ideas. I suggest a sketchbook that has a hardcover so that it will stand up to
            repeated use and travel. A hardcover keeps the corners of the pages inside nice and clean and will help keep
            the pages flat if you use mixed media applications.
        </li>
        <h3>3. Variety of Erasers</h3>
        <li>Erasers can be a great mark-making tool as well. Each eraser
            creates a different mark and should be used as necessary according to the specific drawing medium.

            Here are a few recommended erasers…

        <li>Rubber Eraser – Your standard eraser for erasing graphite. This eraser uses friction to remove any material
            from the surface.</li>

        <li>Kneaded Eraser – This eraser lifts material from the surface, instead of using friction to remove it. It can
            be pulled and fashioned into different forms to create specific marks. This eraser gets dirty over time, but
            can be cleaned by pulling and “kneading” it.</li>

        <li>Gum Eraser – “The Crumbler”. This eraser is great for removing media from surfaces that are sensitive to
            tearing. A gum eraser removes the medium through friction, but crumbles as it does so – preserving the
            surface.</li>

        <li>Vinyl or Plastic Erasers – This eraser is the toughest of the bunch. It can erase almost anything. But be
            warned – this eraser can tear the paper if you’re not careful</li>
        </li>
        <h3>4. A Good Pencil Sharpener</h3>
        <li>Pencils need to be sharpened with a quality pencil sharpener. Use a poor quality sharpener and you could be
            out of a pencil in a matter of moments.

            Pencil sharpeners generally fall into two categories – Manual and electric.</li>
        <h3>5. Charcoal or Conté</h3>
        <li>Charcoal provides a broader range of value and mark-making than what’s possible with graphite. The manner in
            which marks are made is different as well.

            Charcoal comes in both stick and pencil form. Sticks of charcoal are usually either “vine” or “compressed”.
            Vine charcoal is softer and produces lighter marks, while compressed charcoal – which is concentrated,
            produces darker marks.

            Charcoal pencils can be sharpened like graphite pencils, making them great for details.

            Conté is similar to charcoal in richness of color – however the makeup of the material is different.
            Charcoal is burnt organic material, while conté is made of clay constituents.
        </li>
        <h3>6. Drawing Pens / Ink</h3>
        <li>When we draw with ink, we’re forced to master the use of line. Line is used to develop the illusion of form,
            texture, and light. Technical drawing pens are affordable, easy to find, and portable – making them great
            for every budding artist to have. Sakura Micron pens and Steadtler technical ink liners are both fine
            choices.

            When you’re ready to take your ink drawings to another level, you may consider working with a dip or nib
            pen. This traditional approach to pen and ink drawing requires bottled ink. This approach does require a
            little more skill and is obviously less portable, but the resulting drawings have more character and are
            more interesting.
        </li>
        <h3>7. Quality Colored Pencils</h3>
        <li>Colored pencils are everywhere. You can buy them just but anywhere. But this doesn’t mean that every colored
            pencil brand out there will get the best results. Quality matters and so does the type of colored pencil
            that you choose.</li>
